# Resume LaTeX Templates

This page contains useful LaTeX templates for resumes catered to the tech industry. No matter what template you use, make sure that you:

* Have enough space for about 2-3 personal or class projects that are important in highlighting your skills and experience.

* DO NOT HIT RECRUITERS WITH A WALL OF TEXT. Use bullet points. EVERYWHERE.

* For online application, DO NOT submit `.docx` resumes unless you are applying to Microsoft. The safest choice is `.pdf` file format.
