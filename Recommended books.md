* Cracking the Coding Interviews by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

The Bible of guides to technical interviews. The coding questions can seem simple and basic at times, but the advice on specific companies, the suggested timeline, and various tips on the "people" part of the technical interviews still matters! On the bottom line, if this book does nothing to improve your foundation CS knowledge, it tells you roughly what topics will be covered in your interviews so that you can find other sources to study on your own.

* The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena

Beautifully written to get students interested in algorithms. I personally love the War Stories that the author recalled from his own experience in teaching and in working with the tech industry. It shows you how important it is to know your algorithms and how the seemingly theoretical CS-200 Algorithm Analysis is actually quite practical in the real world.
